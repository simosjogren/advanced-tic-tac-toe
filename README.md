Advanced-tic-tac-toe

Project for making a classic tic-tac-toe -game with AI based enemy functionality.
To get maximize the learning, im trying to implement that AI using neuronetworks, although LSE or basic Q-learning would be enough.

Backend will be based on Python due to Python's great ML modules. Frontend HTML/JS. Backend HTTP-requests are implemented by Python flask and frontend by using JS fetch.
Final optimal step would be also to make the tictactoe-board scalable for the AI.
